          This chart shows the number of Anti-Asian hate crimes in New York compiled by the state government from 2010 to 2021. At the beginning of the decade, the numbers were pretty minimal while hovering around a dozen after starting with 20 in 2010. This put Anti-Asian hate crimes well below groups that were targeted the most like African Americans, Jews, or the LGBT community. But all of that changed with the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020. Due to the virus starting in China, racist conspiracy theories and rhetoric began that blamed Asians for creating and spreading COVID. This fed into a hateful environment across the US, including New York, that Asians deserved to be punished for their “crimes” which led to a dramatic spike in racist attacks. From 2019 to 2020, Anti-Asian hate crimes in New York dramatically increased from 5 to 31, which is a 600% increase. Finally, from 2020 to 2021, an even more astonishing increase happened from 31 to 140 hate crimes, which is a 450% increase and 2,800% increase from 2019.
